        Ogun State Community Social Orientation and Safety Corps, or So-Safe Corps, is a security branch of the State Government that was legally created to carry out its constitutional duties of combating crime and criminality. 
        
        A Bill for a law to establish the Ogun State Community Social Orientation and Safety Corps (So-Safe Corps) Agency for the Regulation and Control of Community Social Orientation and Safety Corps Activities and Connected Purposes commenced 27th December 2017.

        The role of So-Safe Corps as established with the law includes assisting the Police and other security Agencies within the State to maintain law and order by gathering information about crime, crime in progress, suspicious activities and crime suspects among other things which also includes putting structure in place to ensure that hoodlums and cult groups do not have opportunity to operate in communities or anywhere within the state by undertaking routine motorized patrol day and night, as well as reducing the crime rate and ensuring that offenders are identified and made to account for their misdeed and following up on arrest of offenders to the Court and ensuring justice.

        The law in same vein provides timely reporting of suspicious activities and crimes in progress to the police or other security agencies, improving relationship between the police and the community as it concerns law enforcement. The law equally stipulates providing the police with relevant information that will enhance their understanding of how to effectively Police the communities, as well as to support the cause of community development especially on issues relating to security.

        Without prejudice to the provision of Section 2 of this Law, the agency engages the service of volunteers (eg-ex-serving men, retirees, baales, chiefs and CDA officials) as Special Marshals in mass orientation of their communities in security consciousness and campaign against social vices. It also serves as the coordinating body for the uniformed and non-uniformed community corps established and operating within all the local government and local council development
